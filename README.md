# Game-Of-Life

Conways Game of Life created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970

- TODO:
  - there is no way the user can choose what shape should be the starting one, always have to create it manually by doing
    map[10][21] = alive, make it so user can change starting shape in a txt file and then program will read from that file and fill the array map
    with the content of file
